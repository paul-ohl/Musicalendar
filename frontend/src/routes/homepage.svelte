		Musicalendar is a personal project of mine. The idea was sparked by my girlfriend having an
		"audio journal" playlist, and wanting a cool way to visualize her year in music. My name is
		Paul, I am a developer from France and you can find me online at paulohl.fr and on LinkedIn.
		Also this project is open-source so you can checkout the code on github!
